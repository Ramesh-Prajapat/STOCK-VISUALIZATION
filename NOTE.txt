NOTE: If you want to avoid the duplicate entry in your mysql table you should try this-
***************************************************************************************
	Step 1: 
		```
		First of all you must be modify your 'id' column from 'AUTO_INCREMENT' to 'INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0'
		bcz without it you can't drop the PRIMARY KEY which is created by default by djanog-admin and you 
		must be drop the primary key bcz without it you can't create anthor primary or multiple primary key
		Syntext of Modify to 'id' column:-
			ALTER TABLE <table name> MODIFY <column name> INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
		```

	Step 2: 
		```
		Now you must be drop primary key from your table:-
		Syntext of drop primary key:-
			ALTER TABLE <table name> DROP PRIMARY KEY;
		```

	Step 3:
		```
		Now you are read to create multiple primary key in your table:-
		I'm going to creating to primary key in my table like....
		Syntext of create multiple primary key:-
			ALTER TABLE <table name> ADD PRIMARY KEY(TICKER,D_DATE);
		```
